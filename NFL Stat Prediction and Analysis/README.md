# NFL Stat Prediction and Analysis

This project aims to predict the fantasy stats of players for the 2021 NFL season, based on historical data. The data used in this project comes from the official NFL website.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to clone the repository and run the `RNW_NFLcapstone_Modeling_Final.ipynb` notebook. The notebook requires several Python packages to be installed, including `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

## Data

The data used in this project consists of NFL player statistics from 1999 to 2019. The data includes a wide range of player statistics, including rushing catches, yards, touchdowns, fumbles, games played, snaps played, and more. The data is pre-processed and cleaned before being used for modeling.

## Modeling

This project uses several machine learning models to predict the number of fantasy stats players will have for the 2021 NFL season. The models include linear regression, random forest regression, and XGBoost regression. The models are trained on the historical data and evaluated using cross-validation techniques.

## Results

The results of the modeling show that the XGBoost regression model performs the best in predicting  Fantasy Points. The model achieves a mean squared error of 870.86 and a mean absolute error of 22.14.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning models to predict NFL player statistics. The results show that the XGBoost regression model performs well in predicting the number of rushing yards a running back will have in the upcoming season. This model can be used to help fantasy football players make informed decisions, or get an edge over league mates ( like it helped me! )
